# Information
I was bored and decided to try something new, what if we could hook Roblox's Lua Functions?
Would we be able to "dump" **roblox** addresses?
I tested the source code on a Lua application my buddy made and it hooked luaL_loadbuffer and allowed me to execute scripts on his application and the application showed the output to all scripts!
So it worked, not sure if it would work for Roblox as i never tried it.

But have fun skidding it kids, hi superskater911? (Is sk8r still alive or what??)
